# Blackjack

### What it does:

Blackjack is a command-line Python application. It is a game where the user plays Blackjack against the computer. After compiling, the user gets Â£100 and types the amount to bet, which is doubled in case of winning, or lost in case of losing. Both players get 2 cards, but the user can only see one card from computer's hand. The computer will draw cards until reaching 17 or more. The user can draw as many cards as they want, but in case of exceeding 21, they lose.
